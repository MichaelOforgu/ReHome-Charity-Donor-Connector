# ReHome: Connecting Donors with Charities

ReHome is a **data-driven prototype platform** designed to revolutionize the way donors connect with charities, reducing household waste and supporting community organizations. By combining the power of **data science**, **machine learning**, and **user-friendly design**, ReHome aims to address pressing societal challenges while contributing to the **United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

## üåç **Project Overview**

Every year, millions of reusable household items are discarded as waste, contributing to **14 million tons of landfill waste** in the UK (DEFRA, 2022). Meanwhile, charities struggle to acquire the resources they need to support their communities. ReHome bridges this gap by:
- Connecting **donors** with nearby charities that need their items.  
- Utilizing **machine learning algorithms** for personalized donor-charity matching.  
- Promoting **circular economy principles** by extending the lifecycle of household items.

## üí° **Key Features**

### **Recommendation System**
The core of ReHome is its intelligent recommendation system, built with:  
1. **Haversine Formula** for precise geographic clustering.  
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** for proximity-based charity recommendations.  
3. **Custom Python functions** for preference matching between donors and charities.  

The system ensures that:  
- Recommendations are **geographically convenient** for donors.  
- Charities' causes align with donors' **values and preferences**.  
- Matching is fast, relevant, and impactful.  

### **User-Centric Prototype**
Designed using **Figma**, the ReHome prototype features an intuitive user interface for both donors and charities. Key components include:  
- **Sign-Up and Login Pages**: Easy onboarding for donors and charities.  
- **Charity Search and Recommendation Pages**: Personalized charity suggestions and search functionality.  
- **Donation Tracking**: Visibility into how donations are used and the impact created.
